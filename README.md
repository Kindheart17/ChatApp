// This is basic Django application 
1. In the base dir which you just unzipped create a virtual env using command: "python -m venv env"
2. Make sure the Environment is activated. If not use this command to activate: ".\env\Scripts\activate"
3. Install the requirements using command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
4. Now change directory in the terminal to 'Chatapp'. Use this command to do this: "cd chatapp"
5. Now run the app using "python manage.py runserver"
6. Open the application by clicking the link shown in the terminal or just visit localhost in your browser. In my case the link was: "localhost:8000".
